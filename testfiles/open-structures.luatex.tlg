Package tagpdf Warning: There are still open structures on the stack!
(tagpdf)                The stack contains {text-unit}{Part},{Document}{Document},{Root}{StructTreeRoot}.
(tagpdf)                The structures are automatically closed,
(tagpdf)                but their nesting can be wrong.
Package tagpdf Info: Finalizing the tagging structure:
(tagpdf)             Writing out ~5 structure objects
(tagpdf)             with ~4 'MC' leaf nodes.
(tagpdf)             Be patient if there are lots of objects!
