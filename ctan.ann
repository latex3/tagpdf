## [2025-06-25]
Version 0.99r

### Added
 - experimental support for Lang keys on MC (not spec conform but 
   works in acrobat)

### Changed
 - links split over a line or a page now create with luatex 
   an OBJR for all annotations (with the help of the lualinksplit 
   code in the pdfmanagement). This improves ua-2 compability.
 
 - files attached with attach-css and related keys are added now to the catalog
   to allow compatibility with PDF/A-3.
